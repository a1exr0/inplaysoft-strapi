# Cache Performance Fix

## Issue Identified
The Strapi cache was not working effectively in production because:

1. **`cacheAuthorizedRequests` was set to `false`** - This caused all authorized requests to bypass the cache entirely, leading to slower response times (63-89ms).

2. **Cache configuration was not optimized** - Settings like TTL, timeout, and cacheable routes needed optimization for production use.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Core Cache Issue
- Changed `cacheAuthorizedRequests: false` to `cacheAuthorizedRequests: true` in `config/plugins.js`
- This allows authorized requests to be cached, significantly improving performance

### 2. Optimized Cache Settings
- **TTL**: Set to 1 week (`604800000ms`) - perfect for CMS content that doesn't change frequently
- **Timeout**: Reduced cache get timeout from 1000ms to 500ms for faster responses
- **Specific Routes**: Added explicit cacheable routes instead of caching all `/api` routes
- **Debug**: Made debug logging configurable (disabled in production)

### 3. Made Configuration Environment-Based
All cache settings are now configurable via environment variables:

```env
CACHE_ENABLED=true
CACHE_DEBUG=false
CACHE_MAX_ITEMS=1000
CACHE_TTL=604800000
CACHE_SIZE=1073741824
CACHE_ALLOW_STALE=false
CACHE_PROVIDER=memory
CACHE_HEADERS=true
CACHE_AUTHORIZED_REQUESTS=true
CACHE_GET_TIMEOUT=500
```

### 4. Specified Cacheable Routes
Added specific routes that should be cached:
- `/api/articles`
- `/api/footer`
- `/api/header`
- `/api/global`
- `/api/home-page`
- `/api/categories`
- `/api/authors`

## Expected Results

After restarting the server, you should see:
1. **Faster response times** - First request ~50-80ms, subsequent cached requests ~5-20ms
2. **Cache hit logs** instead of "bypassing cache" logs
3. **Reduced database queries** for repeated requests
4. **Better overall performance** for your frontend application
5. **Long-term cache effectiveness** - Content cached for up to 1 week (until manually invalidated)

## Verification

To verify the cache is working:
1. Check server logs - should see cache hits instead of bypasses
2. Monitor response times - subsequent requests should be much faster
3. Use the included test scripts: `npm run test:performance`

## Next Steps

For even better performance in production, consider:
1. **Using Redis cache** instead of memory cache for scalability
2. **Implementing cache invalidation strategies** for content updates
3. **Adding cache warming** for critical routes
4. **Monitoring cache hit rates** and adjusting TTL accordingly
